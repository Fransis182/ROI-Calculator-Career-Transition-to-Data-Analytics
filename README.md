## 🎯 Purpose

Personal tool created during my career transition from **F&B Supervisor to Junior Data Analyst** to evaluate financial impact, break-even point, and long-term ROI.

This calculator helps professionals make data-driven decisions about career transitions by visualizing:
- Income projections over 3 years
- Break-even analysis
- ROI percentages
- Cumulative earnings comparison

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React** - UI framework
- **Recharts** - Data visualization library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Lucide React** - Icons

## 📊 Features

✅ **Real-time calculations** - Instant ROI updates as you adjust inputs  
✅ **Interactive inputs** - Customize salary, training costs, job search duration  
✅ **3-year projection** - Long-term income visualization  
✅ **Break-even analysis** - Know when you recover your investment  
✅ **Visual comparisons** - Charts comparing current vs target income  
✅ **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## 💡 Use Case

Designed for professionals considering career transitions to evaluate:
- Income increase potential
- Investment recovery timeline
- Long-term financial impact
- Opportunity cost of staying vs switching

## 🚀 Demo

Currently deployed as a Claude Artifact. Full deployment coming soon.

## 📸 Key Insights (Example)

Based on transition from F&B (€1,500/mo) to Data Analyst (€2,600/mo):
- **Income increase:** +73% (€13,200/year)
- **Break-even:** 4 months
- **3-year gain:** +€39,600

## 🧮 How It Works

The calculator considers:
1. **Current salary** (monthly/annual)
2. **Target salary** (monthly/annual)
3. **Training costs** (courses, certifications)
4. **Job search duration** (months to land first role)

Then calculates:
- Annual income difference
- Break-even point in months
- ROI at 1, 2, and 3 years
- Cumulative income comparison

## 🌱 Non-Financial ROI (Personal Impact)

This project is not only about financial ROI. It also reflects the personal and professional return on investing in my career transition:

- 📚 **Learning growth**: Completing Kaggle courses (Intro to Programming, Functions), daily practice with Claude and ChatGPT, and building my first React component with AI assistance
- 🧠 **Mindset shift**: Moving from "I don't understand code" to "I can read, adapt, and explain AI-generated code and use it as a tool"
- 🎯 **Career clarity**: Defining a clear goal - joining a tech company as a Data Analyst / AI-enabled Analyst, instead of staying in a role that no longer fits me
- 💻 **Tech identity**: Opening my GitHub account, publishing my first project, and starting to see myself as someone who builds tools, not only uses them
- 🤝 **Professional positioning**: Updating my LinkedIn to reflect my transition from F&B Operations to Data Analytics and creating a portfolio that tells this story
- 📈 **Long-term growth**: Treating this project as a first step in a continuous learning journey (Python, SQL, data visualization, AI tools) rather than a one-time exercise

These elements are harder to quantify than salary, but they represent the long-term value of this transition: **skills, identity, opportunities, and the confidence to build a new career in tech.**
