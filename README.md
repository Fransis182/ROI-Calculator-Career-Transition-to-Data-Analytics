This calculator helps professionals make data-driven decisions about career transitions by visualizing:
- Income projections over 3 years
- Break-even analysis
- ROI percentages
- Cumulative earnings comparison

✅ **Real-time calculations** – Instant ROI updates as you adjust inputs  
✅ **Interactive inputs** – Customize salary, training costs, job search duration  
✅ **3-year projection** – Long-term income visualization  
✅ **Break-even analysis** – Know when you recover your investment  
✅ **Visual comparisons** – Charts comparing current vs target income  
✅ **Responsive design** – Works on desktop and mobile  

## 💡 Use Case

4. **Job search duration**
   
## 🌱 Non-Financial ROI (Personal Impact)

This project is not only about financial ROI. It also reflects the personal and professional return on investing in my career transition:

- 📚 **Learning growth**: completing Kaggle courses (Intro to Programming, Functions), daily practice with Claude and ChatGPT, and building my first React component from scratch with AI assistance.
- 🧠 **Mindset shift**: moving from “I don’t understand code” to “I can read, adapt, and explain AI-generated code and use it as a tool.”
- 🎯 **Career clarity**: defining a clear goal — joining a tech company as a Data Analyst / AI-enabled Analyst, instead of staying in a role that no longer fits me.
- 💻 **Tech identity**: opening my GitHub account, publishing my first project, and starting to see myself as someone who builds tools, not only uses them.
- 🤝 **Professional positioning**: updating my LinkedIn to reflect my transition from F&B Operations to Data Analytics and creating a portfolio that tells this story.
- 🔁 **Long-term growth**: treating this project as a first step in a continuous learning journey (Python, SQL, data visualization, AI tools) rather than a one-time exercise.

These elements are harder to quantify than salary, but they represent the long-term value of this transition: skills, identity, opportunities, and the confidence to build a new career in tech.

Calculates:
- Annual income difference  
- Break-even point  
- ROI at 1, 2, and 3 years  
- Cumulative income comparison

  ### Additional Non-Financial Insights (described in this project, not automatically calculated):

- Learning progression during the transition (Python, React, AI tools)
- Skill acquisition aligned with Data Analyst roles
- Improved confidence and clarity about career direction
- Ability to build tools, understand code, and document a complete project
- Development of a professional tech identity (GitHub, portfolio, LinkedIn)
